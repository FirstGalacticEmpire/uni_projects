Tatsuo Yoshida (吉田 竜夫, Yoshida Tatsuo, March 6, 1932 – September 5, 1977) was a Japanese cartoonist, writer, mangaka and anime pioneer who founded the anime studio Tatsunoko Productions.[1]

Born in 1932, Yoshida grew up in the hardship of war-torn Japan. A self-taught artist, his first job was as working for local newspapers in Kyoto. After finding success as a manga artist in Tokyo, including winning the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1972 for The Adventures of Hutch the Honeybee,[2] in 1962 he founded Tatsunoko with his two younger brothers, Kenji (who took over Tatsuo's position as producer after he died) and Toyoharu (a.k.a. Ippei Kuri).[3] The studio's name has a double Japanese meaning of "Tatsu's child" and "sea dragon" which was the inspiration for its seahorse logo.

Yoshida made the jump from print to the screen and found modest success with the anime racing series Mach GoGoGo.[4] Once adapted to the English language market, it achieved resounding, worldwide success as Speed Racer. Yoshida also created the action series Gatchaman (also known as Battle of the Planets and G-Force: Guardians of Space), Casshan (also known as Neo-Human Casshern, now remade as the live-action film Casshern and the continuity reboot Casshern Sins), Hurricane Polymar and Tekkaman: The Space Knight.

Though Tatsuo Yoshida's career was cut short by his untimely death from liver cancer in 1977,[5] Tatsunoko Productions has continued to partner with top creators to create additional hit series such as Macross, Mospeada, Robotech, Generator Gawl, Time Bokan, and Karas.
