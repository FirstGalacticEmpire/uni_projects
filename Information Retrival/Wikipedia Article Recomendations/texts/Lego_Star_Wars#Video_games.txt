Lego Star Wars is a Lego theme that incorporates the Star Wars saga and franchise. Originally it was only licensed from 1999 to 2008, but The Lego Group extended the license with Lucasfilm, first until 2011, then until 2016, then again until 2022.[2] The brand has spawned an eponymous video game series containing six video games, developed by Traveller's Tales: Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005), Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy (2006), Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga (2007), Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars (2011), Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2016) and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga (2022). Many short films and miniseries have also been produced.

Lego Star Wars is based on the Star Wars saga and franchise. The product line directly focuses on the Star Wars characters from the films and TV Series, with the exception of a few special characters.

The Lego Star Wars designers have revealed how they’ve ‘changed strategy’ to get popular minifigures into cheaper and more accessible sets. Lego Star Wars Creative Lead Jens Kronvold Frederiksen explained, “We have changed our strategy a little bit over the years,” and continued, “Where in the past, we often kept some of them – the most important especially – for the higher prices, we are now thinking young kids, maybe newcomers to Star Wars, want to get into it.[3]

The Lego Star Wars designers revealed the Force Ghost minifigures as a result of changes to the company’s transparent plastic. Creative Lead Jens Kronvold Frederiksen, “The reason for not doing it was that the minifigures are made out of many different types of plastic, because they need to have different abilities and characteristics,” Design Director Michael Lee Stockwell explained, “Some have to be flexible, some need to use clutch power and whatnot,” and continued, “So the hands are different material than the heads, for example.”[4]

Lego Star Wars Design Manager Michael Lee Stockwell explained why coming up with playsets based on new shows and movies is trickier than creating vehicles. Referring to a LEGO set based on The Mandalorian, Michael Lee Stockwell explained, “We were interested in [the Armourer’s forge] already from the first season, but we didn’t know enough about the context,” and continued, “We didn’t know enough of what was happening around this. That’s one of the major differences between designing a ship and a playset like this, because it’s sometimes easier to understand a ship."[5]

The Lego Star Wars designers explained the Mandalorian Starfighter (set number: 75316) is a great example of how they decide which sets to produce. Lego Star Wars Creative Lead Jens Kronvold Frederiksen explained, “If it’s something that’s exposed in more places, then there’s a high chance that it’s popular,” and continued, “We did the same thing when creating stuff from The Clone Wars. We always thought the best set was [vehicles] that were both from the prequel movies, but also in The Clone Wars, [because] then we make more people happy."[6]

According to Bricklink, The Lego Group released a total of 824 Lego sets and promotional polybags as part of Lego Star Wars theme.[1]

The first few sets based on the original trilogy were released in 1999, coinciding with the release of The Phantom Menace. The first wave of Lego Star Wars sets included model 7140, an X-wing fighter. Sets based on the prequel trilogy (Episodes I to III) of Star Wars would follow, starting with Episode I – The Phantom Menace. As each new film in the prequel trilogy neared its release date, Lego issued new models of ships and scenes in those films, as well as additional sets from the original trilogy. Lego also produced models based on Clone Wars, The Clone Wars, The Old Republic, The Force Unleashed , Rebels, The Force Awakens, Battlefront, Rogue One, The Last Jedi, Solo, Resistance, The Mandalorian,[7] The Rise of Skywalker and The Bad Batch.[8][9][10][11] Sets based on Galaxy's Edge and The Freemaker Adventures[12] have also been produced.[13]

In addition to the regular Minifigure-scale sets, Lego has released several sets (between 30-36) for the Ultimate Collector Series. These models are often considerably larger, more detailed, and meant more for display purposes than other sets. They often cost more than regular Lego sets as well. Many of them include an information plaque and often a display stand. The largest of these is 75192, the 2017 UCS version of the Millennium Falcon, complete with ten Minifigures. At 7541 pieces, it is the largest Star Wars Lego set ever released; and the second largest set of any collection ever commercially released.[14] On June 5, 2015, an unopened box of the older 2007 Millennium Falcon Lego set (10179) was auctioned at online auction house Catawiki for 5,000 euros (US$5556.5 at the time) making it the most expensive LEGO set ever. In 2021, AT-AT (set number: 75313) will be released on 26 November 2021.[15]

With similar complexity to the Ultimate Collector Series sets, sets under the Master Builder Series are built with the purpose of playing, featuring numerous play features, functions, and interior details as compared to the UCS, which are meant more for display purposes. The first set of the MBS is the 75222 Betrayal at Cloud City, which was released in 2018.[16] In 2020, 75290 Mos Eisley Cantina was released as the largest MBS set with over 3,000 pieces and 21 minifigures.[17][18]

In 2020, Lego released three brick-built helmets of selected iconic characters from the Star Wars universe. They are 75277 Boba Fett, 75276 Stormtrooper, and 75274 TIE Fighter Pilot. Meant to be displayed, name plaques of the helmets' characters are included.[19] In March 2021, Lego announced that it will be releasing helmets 75304 Darth Vader, and 75305 Scout Trooper on April 26, 2021.[20][21][22][23]

The minifigure with the first code, i.e. sw0001, is a tan battle droid that appeared in The Phantom Menace.[24] Some minifigures repeatedly appear across multiple Lego sets, while others can be very rare, vastly increasing their resale value. In 2019, the number of Lego Star Wars minifigures has surpassed 1000, with the Battlefront II protagonist Iden Versio bearing code sw1000.[25][26][27]

Lego design master Kurt Kristiansen had revealed the R2-D2 (set number: 75308). Kurt Kristiansen explained, “Well R2-D2 is a bit of a fun thing for me cause I’ve been revisiting the design for almost 10 years,” and continued, “So it was quite a challenge to reinvent the model.”[28]

The designer video for Imperial Probe Droid (set number: 75306) explains some of the challenges that went into making the robotic model. Lego designer Jan Neergaard Olesen explained, “It’s the first model I made totally in 3d, we have a program that we use and this was the first model where I spent a lot of time building it in 3D at home,” and continued, “But the thing is, in 3D programs you don’t have gravity and with a model like this that have a very high pivot point, it’s going to cause some challenges”[29]

On August 1, 2020, Lego released 31200 Star Wars The Sith under the Lego Art theme. It consists of 3,406 pieces and offers builders the option to recreate any one of the three Star Wars villains (Darth Maul, Kylo Ren, and Darth Vader) in a mosaic-like format using Lego 1x1 studs.[30]

Lego has since released 20 Star Wars themed sets under the Lego BrickHeadz theme. They include characters from the sequel trilogy, the original trilogy and The Mandalorian.[31]

First Order Stormtrooper and BB-8 was released as a part of Lego Brick Sketches theme.[32][33]

Traveller's Tales president Jon Burton stated in a July 2008 interview with Variety that the series had collectively sold 15 million copies.[43] As of February 13, 2009, Lego Star Wars: The Video Game has sold over 6.8 million copies worldwide, Lego Star Wars II has sold over 8.3 million, The Complete Saga has sold over 4.1 million, and the three combined have sold over 21 million.[44] In May 2009, Wired reported combined sales of 20 million.[45] As of 2012, all Lego Star Wars video games had collectively sold more than 30 million copies.[46][47] As of 2016, more than 36 million games were sold.[48] As of 2019, the series has sold more than 50 million copies of Lego Star Wars video games.[49]

Several films and videos based on Lego Star Wars have been produced; additionally, Lego Star Wars characters cameo in The Lego Movie (2014).

The series continued to a second season with five episodes airing in 2014 but now renamed "The New Yoda Chronicles" to avoid legal disputes over ownership between Disney and Cartoon Network.[citation needed]
