The following is a list of the best-selling Japanese manga series to date in terms of the number of collected tankōbon volumes sold. All series in this list have at least 20 million copies in circulation. This list is limited to Japanese manga and does not include manhwa, manhua or original English-language manga. The series are listed according to the highest sales estimate of their collected tankōbon volumes as reported in reliable sources.

Note that most manga series are first sold as part of manga magazines, where most manga series are first serialized, before being sold separately as individual collected tankōbon volumes. This list only includes the number of collected tankōbon volumes sold. For sales of manga magazines which includes these series, see List of Japanese manga magazines by circulation. The best-selling manga magazine (and best-selling comic magazine) is Weekly Shōnen Jump, with over 7.5 billion copies sold.[1] Estimated circulation figures for individual manga series published in manga magazines are given in footnotes.[a]
