David Bruce Norman (born 20 June 1952 in the United Kingdom) is a British paleontologist, currently the main curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge University.[1] For many years until 2013, Norman has also been the Sedgwick Museum's director.

Norman is a fellow at Christ's College, Cambridge where he teaches Earth Sciences in the Natural Sciences tripos. A member of the Palaeontological Association,[2] he has studied Iguanodon[3] and also has participated in the studies and scientific surveys included in the dinosaur work The Dinosauria (2nd edition, 2004). The species epithet of Equijubus normani was named in honour of him.[4]

In 2017, Dr Norman was one of three British palaeontologists who proposed a radical new hypothesis for early dinosaur evolution and interrelationships in a paper in the journal Nature. In this work, Dr Matthew Grant Baron, Dr David Bruce Norman and Prof. Paul Michael Barrett (2017) suggested that Ornithischia and Theropoda were closely related as part of a new clade that they named Ornithoscelida.[5]

He also possesses a keen interest in rugby, and he regularly referees for Cambridge University and District Rugby Referees Society (CUDRRS), earning himself the nickname 'Refosaurus Rex'.
