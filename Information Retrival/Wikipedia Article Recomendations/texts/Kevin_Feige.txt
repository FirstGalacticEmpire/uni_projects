Kevin Feige (/ˈfaɪɡi/ FY-ghee; born June 2, 1973)[1] is an American film and television producer who has been the president of Marvel Studios and the primary producer of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise since 2007.[2] The films he has produced have a combined worldwide box office gross of over $26.8 billion,[3] making him the highest grossing producer of all time, with Avengers: Endgame becoming the highest-grossing film on its release.

Feige is a member of the Producers Guild of America. In 2018, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture for producing Black Panther, the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination and the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to win an Academy Award. In October 2019 he became chief creative officer of Marvel Entertainment.

Feige was born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in Westfield, New Jersey,[1][4] where he graduated from Westfield High School.[5] His maternal grandfather, Robert E. Short, was a television producer in the 1950s, working on soap operas including The Guiding Light and As the World Turns.[6][7][8]

After high school, Feige applied to the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, the alma mater of his favorite directors: George Lucas, Ron Howard and Robert Zemeckis. His first five applications were rejected, but he was accepted on the sixth.[7]

His early work includes being assistant to executive producer Lauren Shuler Donner on Volcano and You've Got Mail.

In 2000, he was hired by Marvel as a producer.[7]

On the first X-Men film, Donner made Feige an associate producer, due to his knowledge of the Marvel Universe.[4] Impressing Avi Arad, he was hired to work as his second-in-command at Marvel Studios that same year.[10] In the mid-2000s, Feige realized that although  Spider-Man and the X-Men had been licensed to Sony and 20th Century Fox, Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers, and envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.[11]

Feige was named president of production for Marvel Studios in March 2007.[12]

Feige received the Motion Picture Showman of the Year award at the ICG Publicists Guild Awards on February 22, 2013.[13]

For his work on Black Panther, Feige received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Producers Guild of America Award.[14]

Feige was awarded the David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures by the Producers Guild of America in 2019.[15] On September 26, 2019, it was reported that Feige is developing a Star Wars film for Lucasfilm.[16]

In October 2019, Feige, in addition to being President of Marvel Studios, was named Chief Creative Officer for Marvel Comics, Marvel Television and Marvel Animation.[17]

Feige is married to Caitlin, a cardiothoracic nurse.[18] They have two children: a daughter born in 2009, and a son born in 2012.[19]
