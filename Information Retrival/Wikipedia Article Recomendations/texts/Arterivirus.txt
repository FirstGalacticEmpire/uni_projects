Arteriviridae is a family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales which infect vertebrates.[1][2] Host organisms include equids, pigs, opossums, nonhuman primates, and rodents. The family includes, for example, equine arteritis virus in horses which causes mild-to-severe respiratory disease and reproductive failure, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 and type 2 in pigs which causes a similar disease, simian hemorrhagic fever virus which causes a highly lethal fever, lactate dehydrogenase–elevating virus which affects mice, and wobbly possum disease virus.[3][4]

Member viruses are enveloped, spherical, and 45–60 nm in diameter.[5]

Arteriviruses have a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome.[5]

The family Arteriviridae contains the subfamilies:[6]
