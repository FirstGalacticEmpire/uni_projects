The Book of Boba Fett is an upcoming American television series created for the streaming service Disney+. It is part of the Star Wars franchise, a spin-off from the series The Mandalorian featuring the bounty hunter Boba Fett from that series and other Star Wars media. The series takes place alongside the other The Mandalorian spin-off Ahsoka.

Temuera Morrison stars as Boba Fett, with Ming-Na Wen also starring as Fennec Shand. Both reprise their roles from The Mandalorian and other previous Star Wars media. Several attempts were made at developing a standalone Star Wars film centered on Boba Fett before Lucasfilm began prioritizing its streaming series such as The Mandalorian. Morrison appeared as Fett alongside Wen in the second season of The Mandalorian, and a potential spin-off series was first reported in November 2020. The Book of Boba Fett was officially announced in December 2020, with Morrison and Wen starring. Filming had begun by that point, and lasted until June 2021.

The series is set to premiere on December 29, 2021, and will run for seven episodes until February 9, 2022.

The series consists of seven episodes.[6] Robert Rodriguez directed three episodes of the series,[7] while Jon Favreau, Bryce Dallas Howard, Dave Filoni,[8] Steph Green, and Kevin Tancharoen were also reported to have directed episodes.[9]

In February 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the development of several Star Wars standalone spin-off films. One was reportedly centered on the bounty hunter character Boba Fett, and would either take place between Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980) or The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (1983).[10] The film was also said to explore the other bounty hunters seen in The Empire Strikes Back.[11] In early 2014, Simon Kinberg approached director Josh Trank about making a Star Wars film, and Trank made a pitch for a Boba Fett film to Star Wars producer Lucasfilm;[12] he was hired to direct that June.[13] Trank was scheduled to announce the film at Star Wars Celebration Anaheim in April 2015, and also reveal a teaser for the project,[14] but this was canceled at the last minute after Lucasfilm became aware of the troubled production on Trank's film Fantastic Four (2015).[12] In May 2015, Trank was no longer working on the film.[15] A Boba Fett film was reportedly still being considered by Lucasfilm as of August 2017.[16] Following the financial failure of the film Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), Disney reconsidered their Star Wars film output. By October 2018, the Boba Fett film was no longer moving forward, and Lucasfilm was prioritizing the Disney+ streaming series The Mandalorian instead.[11][17]

Iger said in February 2020 that spin-offs of The Mandalorian were being considered, and there was potential to add more characters to the series with the intention of then giving them their own series.[18] In May, Temuera Morrison was set to appear as Boba Fett in the second season of The Mandalorian.[19][20] Morrison portrayed Boba's father Jango Fett in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002), and went on to provide the voice of Boba in various Star Wars media.[19] Before Morrison's involvement in The Mandalorian was confirmed, Fett briefly appeared in the first season episode "Chapter 5: The Gunslinger" alongside the character Fennec Shand, portrayed by Ming-Na Wen.[20][21] Morrison makes a short appearance in the second-season premiere, "Chapter 9: The Marshal", before being fully introduced in "Chapter 14: The Tragedy", directed by Robert Rodriguez.[22]

By early November 2020, production on either the third season of The Mandalorian or a potential spin-off series focusing on Boba Fett was believed to be scheduled to begin later that month or in early December.[23] A Boba Fett spin-off series was not announced by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy at Disney's Investor Day event on December 10, when The Mandalorian spin-offs Rangers of the New Republic and Ahsoka were announced; Kennedy said those series exist within The Mandalorian's timeline and were planned to culminate in a "climactic story event".[24] Kennedy did announce that the "next chapter" of The Mandalorian story would premiere in December 2021.[25]

The Mandalorian's second-season finale, "Chapter 16: The Rescue", was released later in December 2020. It includes a "surprise end-credit sequence" that revealed The Book of Boba Fett was coming December 2021.[26] This led to some confusion and speculation among commentators who believed this was a subtitle for the third season of The Mandalorian, and that The Mandalorian would be switching focus from its title character Din Djarin to Boba Fett with the third season.[2] Jon Favreau, The Mandalorian's creator and showrunner, soon clarified that The Book of Boba Fett was its own series, separate from the third season of The Mandalorian. He explained that the spin-off was not announced by Kennedy at the Investor Day event because they did not want to "spoil the surprise" of the reveal at the end of "Chapter 16: The Rescue". He added that production had already begun on the spin-off. It is executive produced by Favreau, Dave Filoni, and Rodriguez,[2] with Rodriguez directing several of the series' episodes.[3] Like the other spin-offs, The Book of Boba Fett is also set within the timeline of The Mandalorian,[2] and has been described as "The Mandalorian season 2.5".[27][28] The production referred to each episode of The Book of Boba Fett as if it was a third season of The Mandalorian; for example, the first episode was referred to as "301" rather than the typical "101" for a series' first episode.[28] The series consists of seven episodes.[6]

With the series' official announcement in December 2020, Temuera Morrison and Ming-Na Wen were confirmed to be reprising their respective roles of Boba Fett and Fennec Shand from The Mandalorian and other previous Star Wars media.[2] Before the announcement, Wen had assumed that she had been hired as a series regular for the third season of The Mandalorian.[28] Additional characters from The Mandalorian are expected to appear.[27] Jennifer Beals was revealed to be a part of the series in November 2021.[1]

Filming for the series began by late November 2020,[2][23] on the StageCraft video wall volume in Los Angeles that was previously used for the first two seasons of The Mandalorian.[27] COVID-19 safety guidelines were followed on set, with crew members wearing masks and face shields around actors, rapid testing for COVID-19 every three days, and normal testing for the virus once a week.[29] After two weeks of filming, members of the cast and crew learned that they were making The Book of Boba Fett rather than The Mandalorian season three.[28] Rodriguez directed three episodes of the series,[7] with Favreau, Bryce Dallas Howard, Filoni,[8] Steph Green, and Kevin Tancharoen also reported to have directed episodes.[9] Dean Cundey served as a cinematographer on the series.[30] Filming wrapped by June 8, 2021,[31] with Obi-Wan Kenobi taking over the Los Angeles soundstages.[27]

Industrial Light and Magic will provide visual effects for the series.[32]

By late September 2021, scoring sessions for the series had begun with The Mandalorian composer Ludwig Göransson returning for The Book of Boba Fett.[33]

The series is set to premiere on Disney+ on December 29, 2021,[34] and consists of seven episodes[6] that will be released weekly until February 9, 2022.[35]
