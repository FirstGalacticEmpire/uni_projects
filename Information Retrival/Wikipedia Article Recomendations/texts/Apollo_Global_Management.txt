Apollo Global Management, Inc. is a global alternative investment management firm. It invests in credit, private equity, and real assets.[1] As of December 31, 2020, the company had $455.5 billion of assets under management, including $328.6 billion invested in credit, including mezzanine capital, hedge funds, non-performing loans and collateralized loan obligations, $80.7 billion invested in private equity, and $46.2 billion invested in real assets, which includes real estate and infrastructure. The company invests money on behalf of pension funds, financial endowments and sovereign wealth funds, as well as other institutional and individual investors.[1] Since inception in 1990, private equity funds managed by Apollo have produced a 24% internal rate of return (IRR) to investors, net of fees.[2]

Apollo was founded in 1990 by Leon Black, Josh Harris,[3] and Marc Rowan.[4] Apollo is headquartered in the Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street in New York City,[1] with offices across North America, Europe and Asia.[5] Among the most notable companies in which funds managed by the company have invested include ADT Inc., CareerBuilder, Cox Media Group, Intrado, Rackspace, Redbox, Shutterfly, Sirius Satellite Radio, Smart & Final, University of Phoenix, and Yahoo!.

In addition to its private funds, Apollo operates Apollo Investment Corporation (AIC), a US-domiciled publicly traded private equity closed-end fund and business development company. AIC provides mezzanine debt, senior secured loans, and equity investments to middle-market companies, including public companies, although it historically has not invested in companies controlled by Apollo's private equity funds.[6][7]

Apollo, originally referred to as Apollo Advisors, was founded in 1990, after the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert in February 1990, by Leon Black, the former head of Drexel's mergers and acquisitions department, along with other Drexel alumni.[8] Among the most notable founders are John Hannan, Drexel's former co-director of international finance; Craig Cogut, a lawyer who worked with Drexel's high-yield division in Los Angeles; and Arthur Bilger, the former head of the corporate finance department. Other founding partners included Marc Rowan, Josh Harris, and Michael Gross, who both worked under Black in the mergers and acquisitions department, and Antony Ressler, who worked as a senior vice president in Drexel's high yield department with responsibility for the new issue/syndicate desk.[9][10][11]

Within six months after the collapse of Drexel, the Apollo launched Apollo Investment Fund L.P., the first of its private equity investment funds, formed to make investments in distressed companies. Apollo raised approximately $400 million of investor commitments based on Leon Black's reputation as a prominent lieutenant of Michael Milken and a key player in the buyout boom of the 1980s.[9]

Lion Advisors (or Lion Capital) was founded in 1990 to provide investment services to Credit Lyonnais and foreign institutions, seeking to profit from depressed prices in the high yield market.[12] In 1992, Lion entered into a more formal arrangement to manage the $3 billion high-yield portfolio for Credit Lyonnais which together with a consortium of other international investors provided the capital for Lion's investment activities. Lion Advisors was replaced by Ares Management.

At the time of Apollo's founding, there was little financing for new leveraged buyouts and Apollo turned instead to a strategy of distressed-to-control takeovers.[13][14] Apollo purchased distressed securities which could be converted into a controlling interest in the equity of the company through a bankruptcy reorganization or other restructuring. Apollo used distressed debt as an entry point, enabling the firm to invest in such firms as Vail Resorts,[15] Walter Industries,[16][17] Culligan, and Samsonite.[18]

Apollo acquired interests in companies that Drexel had helped finance by purchasing high-yield bonds from failed savings and loans and insurance companies. Apollo acquired several large portfolios of assets from the U.S. government's Resolution Trust Corporation.[19] One of Apollo's earliest and most successful deals involved the acquisition of Executive Life Insurance Company's bond portfolio. Using this vehicle, Apollo purchased the Executive Life portfolio, profiting when the value of high yield bonds recovered, but also resulting in a variety of state regulatory issues for Apollo and Credit Lyonnais over the purchase.[20]

In 1993, Apollo Real Estate Advisers was founded in collaboration with William Mack to seek opportunities in the U.S. property markets.[21]

In April 1993, Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund, L.P., the first in a family of real estate "opportunity funds", was closed with $500 million of investor commitments.

In 2000, Apollo exited the partnership, which continued to operate as Apollo Real Estate Advisers until changing its name to AREA Property Partners effective January 15, 2009. That firm was then owned and controlled by its remaining principals, including William Mack, Lee Neibart, William Benjamin, John Jacobsson, Stuart Koenig, and Richard Mack.[22]

In 1995, Apollo raised its third private equity fund, Apollo Investment Fund III, with $1.5 billion of investor commitments from investors that included CalPERS and the General Motors pension fund.[23] Fund III was only an average performer for private equity funds of its vintage. Among the investments made in Fund III (invested through 1998) were: Alliance Imaging, Allied Waste Industries, Breuners Home Furnishings, Levitz Furniture,[24] Communications Corporation of America, Dominick's, Ralphs (acquired Apollo's Food-4-Less), Move.com, NRT Incorporated,[25] Pillowtex Corporation,[26] Telemundo,[27] and WMC Mortgage Corporation.[28]

Also in 1995, Apollo founding partner Craig Cogut left the firm to found Pegasus Capital Advisors. Since inception, Pegasus has raised $1.8 billion in four private equity funds focused on investments in middle-market companies in financial distress.

In 1997, Apollo co-founder Tony Ressler founded Ares Management as the successor to its Lion Advisors business to manage collateralized debt obligation vehicles.[29]

In 1998, during the dot-com bubble, Apollo raised Apollo Investment Fund IV with $3.6 billion of investor commitments. As of April 8, 2008, the fund had generated a 10% IRR net of fees.[30] Among the investments made in Fund IV (invested through 2001) were: Allied Waste Industries,[31] AMC Entertainment,[32] Berlitz International,[33] Clark Retail Enterprises,[34] Corporate Express (Buhrmann), Encompass Services Corporation, National Financial Partners,[35] Pacer International,[36] Rent-A-Center, Resolution Performance Products, Resolution Specialty Materials, Sirius Satellite Radio,[37] SkyTerra Communications, United Rentals, and Wyndham Worldwide.[38]

In April 2001, Apollo raised Apollo Investment Fund V with $3.7 billion of investor commitments. As of April 8, 2008, the fund had generated a 54% IRR net of fees.[30] Among the investments made in Fund V (invested through 2006) were Affinion Group, AMC Entertainment, Berry Plastics, Cablecom, Compass Minerals, General Nutrition Centers (GNC), Goodman Global, Hexion Specialty Chemicals (Borden), Intelsat, Linens 'n Things, Metals USA, Nalco Investment Holdings, Sourcecorp, Spectrasite Communications, and Unity Media.

Although the founders of Ares had completed a corporate spin-off with the formation of the firm in 1997, they had initially maintained a close relationship with Apollo and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo.[39][citation needed]

In 2002, when Ares raised its first corporate opportunities fund, the firm announced that it would separate from its former parent company. The timing of this separation also coincided with Apollo's legal difficulties with the State of California over its purchase of Executive Life Insurance Company in 1991.[40] In 2002, Attorney General of California Bill Lockyer accused Apollo, Leon Black, and an investor group led by French bank Credit Lyonnais of violating California law by having a foreign government-owned bank acquire the assets and bond portfolio of Executive Life Insurance Co. in 1991. Foreign banks are not allowed to own California insurance companies.[41]

Following the spin-off of Ares in 2002, Apollo developed two new affiliates to continue its investment activities in the capital markets. The first of these new affiliates, founded in 2003, was Apollo Distressed Investment Fund (DIF) Management a credit opportunity investment vehicle.

In 2004, Apollo Real Estate acquired the Value Enhancement Funds family of investment vehicles to broaden its offerings in the "value-added" segment of the real estate investment spectrum.[42]

In 2005, Apollo formed Hexion Specialty Chemicals through the merger of Borden, Inc., Resolution Performance Products LLC, and Resolution Specialty Materials LLC, and the acquisition of Bakelite AG. Hexion announced in July 2007 that it was acquiring Huntsman Corporation, a major specialty chemicals company, in a $6.5 billion leveraged buyout. Hexion announced in June 2008 it would refuse to close the deal, prompting a series of legal actions. The transaction was terminated on December 14 after a settlement between Hexion and Huntsman, wherein they were required to pay Huntsman $1 billion to drop fraud charges that would have potentially sent the CEO of Apollo to prison.[45][46]

Between 2005 and 2007 the private equity market was booming, with new "largest buyout" records set and surpassed several times in an 18-month window.[47] Although Apollo was involved in a number of notable and large buyouts, the firm avoided the very largest transactions during the time. Among Apollo's most notable investments during this period included Harrah's Entertainment, a gaming and casino company; Norwegian Cruise Line, a cruise line operator; Claire's Stores, a retailer of costume jewelry; and Realogy, a real estate franchisor.[48]

AAA was formed to invest alongside Apollo's main private equity funds and hedge funds.[6][7] AAA's investment portfolio was made up of a mix of private equity and capital markets investments. It was liquidated in 2020.[56]

In November 2008, Realogy launched an exchange offer for a portion of its debt to provide additional flexibility, prompting a lawsuit from Carl Icahn.[68][69][70][71] In 2013, Apollo sold out of this investment, making a profit of $1.3 billion.[72]
