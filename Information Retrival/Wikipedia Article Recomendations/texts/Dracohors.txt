Dracohors is a clade of dinosauriform archosaurs that includes dinosaurs and silesaurids.[1] The oldest known dracohortian is Asilisaurus, dating to about 245 million years ago in the Anisian age of the middle Triassic period.[2] According to Andrea Cau (2018), the synapomorphies of dracohortians are:[1] 
Cau defined the group as the "most inclusive clade containing Megalosaurus bucklandii Mantell, 1827, but excluding Marasuchus lilloensis (Romer, 1971)."[1] A good consensus of phylogenetic work supports the sister grouping of silesaurids and dinosaurs,[2][3][4] but the interrelationships within Dinosauria have been debated. Of particular debate are the positions of various basal Triassic dinosaurs such as Eodromaeus, Daemonosaurus, Pisanosaurus,[5][6][7] and herrerasaurids;[1][8] and the interrelationships of the major dinosaur groups Sauropodomorpha, Theropoda, and Ornithischia.[9] The reason for this uncertainty is the taxon sampling size and the implications of how they affect the coding for the phylogenetic tree.[10]

In his paper about the stepwise evolution of the avian bauplan, Cau (2018) found in the parsimony analysis a polytomy between herrerasaur-grade taxa, Sauropodomorpha and the controversial Ornithoscelida. The Bayesian analysis, however, found weak support for the sister grouping of Dinosauria and Herrerasauria, but strong support for the dichotomy between Sauropodomorpha and Ornithoscelida, as shown below:[1]

Its name is formed by haplology from Latin draco (dragon, [large] snake) and cohors (cohort (military unit)). Its Latin genitive is dracohortis.[11]

Most names of animal clades are plurals (e.g. Saurischia = "those with hips like the hips of lizards"), but Dracohors (meaning "the dragon cohort") is the singular of a collective noun.
