The Star Wars franchise has spawned multiple films and television series. Two animated series were released in the mid-1980s. Further animated series began to be released in the 2000s, the first two of which focused on the prequel trilogy-era Clone Wars. After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, only The Clone Wars was kept in the canon of continuity of the episodic Star Wars films. Two additional half-hour animated series were created: Rebels, which ties into the original trilogy, and Resistance, which ties into the sequel trilogy. An additional series spun off from The Clone Wars, titled The Bad Batch, debuted on Disney+ in 2021.

At least seven original Star Wars series will be released on Disney+. The first live-action series in the franchise, The Mandalorian, premiered in November 2019, and spawned three spin-offs, The Book of Boba Fett, Rangers of the New Republic and Ahsoka. Additional live-action series include Andor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, The Acolyte, and Lando.

George Lucas created his own animation company, Lucasfilm Animation, and used it to produce his first in-house Star Wars CGI-animated series, using Cartoon Network's 2003 Clone Wars micro-series as a "pilot".[11] The Clone Wars (2008–2020) was introduced through a 2008 animated film of the same name.[12] The series is set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith of the prequel trilogy.[13] It focuses mainly on the Jedi characters of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, as well as Anakin's Padawan apprentice, Ahsoka Tano (an original character created by Filoni for the series), with other characters from the live-action films in supporting roles. The series marked the beginning of Dave Filoni's involvement in Star Wars animation projects.
