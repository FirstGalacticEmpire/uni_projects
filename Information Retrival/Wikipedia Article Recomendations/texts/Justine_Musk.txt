Justine Musk (born Jennifer Justine Wilson; September 2, 1972)[1][2][3] is a Canadian author.

Musk is the author of the contemporary fantasy novel BloodAngel,[4] published in 2005 by the Roc Books imprint of Penguin Books. Her second book, Uninvited, was released in 2007 and is an unrelated work intended for young-adult readers. A sequel to BloodAngel, Lord of Bones, was released in 2008.[5] Musk was one of the first people to use a site like Pinterest to plan out a novel.[6]

In a 2007 interview, she identified Margaret Atwood, Joyce Carol Oates, Paul Theroux, George R.R. Martin, Guy Gavriel Kay, and Neil Gaiman as authors to whom she could relate her writings.[7] She also described her books as cross-genre fiction.

Justine Wilson was born in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada and she spent most of her early life there. She attended Queen's University in Kingston and obtained a degree in English literature. She then moved to Japan where she taught English as a second language (ESL) before finally settling in California.[8]

In January 2000, she married Elon Musk, who later during their marriage became CEO of Tesla and founder of SpaceX. Their first son, Nevada, was born in 2002 and died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[8]

Through in vitro fertilization, she gave birth in 2004 to twin boys, Griffin and Xavier, and in 2006 to triplets Damian, Saxon, and Kai.[9] On September 13, 2008, she announced that she and Musk were getting a divorce.[10] She and Musk share custody of their children.[11] She later wrote an article for Marie Claire titled "I Was a Starter Wife" detailing ways in which she thought the marriage was unhealthy. Elon frequently belittled her, discouraged her from career pursuits, and pressured her to dye her hair blonde.[8] As of 2010, she claimed to be a "model former wife", and said she was on good terms with Elon's then-second wife, Talulah Riley.[12]
