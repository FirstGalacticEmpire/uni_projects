Jurassic Park, later also referred to as Jurassic World,[1] is an American science fiction media franchise centered on a disastrous attempt to create a theme park of cloned dinosaurs.  

It began in 1990 when Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment bought the rights to Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park before it was published. The book was successful, as was Steven Spielberg's 1993 film adaptation. The film received a theatrical 3D re-release in 2013,[2] and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". A 1995 sequel novel, The Lost World, was followed by a film adaptation in 1997. Subsequent films in the series, including Jurassic Park III (2001), are not based on the novels. 

In 2015, a second trilogy of films began with the fourth film in the series, Jurassic World. The movie was successful, becoming the first film to gross over $500 million worldwide in its opening weekend,[3] and grossed over $1.6 billion through the course of its theatrical run, making it the third highest-grossing film at the time. When adjusted for monetary inflation, Jurassic World is the second highest-grossing film in the franchise after Jurassic Park. A sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, making it the third Jurassic film to pass the billion dollar mark. It is the third highest-grossing film of 2018 and the 13th highest-grossing film of all time. The final film in the trilogy, Jurassic World: Dominion, is scheduled to be released on June 10, 2022. 

Numerous video games and comic books based on the franchise have been created since the release of the 1993 film, and several water rides have been opened at various Universal Studios theme parks. Lego has produced several animated projects based on the Jurassic World films, including a miniseries released in 2019. DreamWorks Animation and Netflix also released an animated series, Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous, on September 18, 2020. As of 2000, the franchise had generated $5 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.[4]

The Jurassic Park franchise focuses on resurrected dinosaurs which wreak havoc on humans. The dinosaurs, created as theme park attractions, are cloned through genetic engineering. The process is accomplished by extracting ancient DNA from mosquitoes, which sucked the blood of dinosaurs and then became fossilized in amber, preserving the DNA.[5] Although the films primarily take place on islands, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) sees the dinosaurs relocated throughout the world, including the U.S. mainland.[6]

The film series is notable for its recreation of dinosaurs, achieved primarily through animatronics and computer-generated imagery.[7][8] The first film was praised for its dinosaur effects, and created an increased interest in the field of paleontology, while changing the public perception of dinosaurs with its modern portrayal.[9][10] Later films largely ignored recent paleontological findings to maintain continuity with the earlier installments, leading to criticism among paleontologists.[11][12][13] Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) will introduce feathered dinosaurs, in line with modern discoveries.[14]

International Genetic Technologies, Inc. (InGen) is the fictional company responsible for cloning the dinosaurs. According to the novels, it is based in Palo Alto, California, and has one location in Europe as well.[nb 1] Nevertheless, most of InGen's research took place on the fictional islands of Isla Sorna and Isla Nublar, near Costa Rica.[nb 1][nb 2] While the first novel indicated InGen was just one of any number of small 1980s genetic engineering start-ups, the events of the novel and film revealed to a select group that InGen had discovered a method for cloning dinosaurs, which would be placed in an island theme park attraction.[nb 1] By the time that Jurassic World takes place, InGen has been bought out by the Masrani Global Corporation.

Beacham's Encyclopedia of Popular Fiction describes InGen as comparable to other "sleazy organizations".[15] Other sources reference the company's receiving a baby T. rex (in The Lost World: Jurassic Park) as an allusion to other exploitative entrepreneurs depicted in the 1933 film King Kong.[16] Ken Gelder describes InGen as "resolutely secretive, just like the firm in Grisham's novel".[17]

InGen's corporate rival in the novels is Biosyn, which was omitted from the film adaptations,[18] but is featured in early video games.[nb 3] Biosyn will make its film debut in Jurassic World: Dominion (2022).[18]

Isla Nublar is a fictional island that serves as a major setting in the first novel and its film adaptation, as well as the films Jurassic World and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. According to the novel, its name means "Cloud Island" in Spanish. The tropical island is located 120 miles west of Costa Rica and has an inactive volcano. In the first novel and film, Isla Nublar is the location of Jurassic Park, a dinosaur theme park proposed by InGen, but it fails to open after the animals escape. In the novel, the Costa Rican government declares the island unsafe and has it napalmed; in the film series, the island continues to exist until the Jurassic World trilogy.

In Jurassic World, the theme park idea has been carried out successfully by Masrani Global Corporation. By the end of the film however, the island is overrun by dinosaurs once more. In Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Isla Nublar is destroyed when its volcano becomes active again and erupts.[22]

Isla Sorna, also called Site B, is another fictional island. It is 87 miles southwest of Isla Nublar, and 207 miles west of Costa Rica. It is the main setting for the second novel and its film adaptation, as well as the third film. Isla Sorna is where InGen conducted much of its dinosaur research. It is here that the dinosaurs were bred before being shipped off to Isla Nublar; a laboratory on the latter island was built only as a showroom for tourists. Isla Sorna is significantly larger than Isla Nublar and has various climates including tropical, highland tropical and temperate rainforest. At the end of the second film, it is stated that Isla Sorna has been set up as a biological preserve for the animals.[23] Isla Sorna is part of a five-island chain known as Las Cinco Muertes (The Five Deaths), although the other islands do not play a role in the novels or films.

The status of Isla Sorna is not mentioned in Jurassic World or Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, but a promotional website for the latter film states that the island ecosystem suffered a breakdown after illegally cloned animals were introduced there. The surviving dinosaurs were relocated to Isla Nublar for the opening of the Jurassic World theme park, leaving Sorna abandoned.[24][23]

In 1983, Michael Crichton originally conceived a screenplay about a pterosaur being cloned from fossil DNA.[25] After wrestling with this idea for a while, he came up with the story of Jurassic Park.[26] Crichton worked on the book for several years; he decided his first draft would have a theme park for the setting (similar to his 1973 film Westworld) and a young boy as the main character.[25] Response was extremely negative, so Crichton rewrote the story to make it from an adult's point of view, which resulted in more positive feedback.[25]

Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the TV series ER. Warner Bros. Pictures, Columbia Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and Universal Pictures bid for the rights to the novel before its publication. In May 1990, Universal acquired the rights, with the backing of Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment.[27] Crichton put up a non-negotiable fee for $1.5Â million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. Universal further paid Crichton $500,000 to adapt his own novel (Malia Scotch Marmo, who was a writer on Spielberg's 1991 film Hook, wrote the next draft of Jurassic Park, but was not credited; David Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel's exposition and violence, and made numerous changes to the characters).[28] Universal desperately needed money to keep their company alive, and partially succeeded with Jurassic Park, as it became a critical[29] and commercial[30] success.

After the film adaptation of Jurassic Park was released to home video, Crichton was pressured from many sources for a sequel novel.[31] Crichton declined all offers until Spielberg himself told him that he would be keen to direct a movie adaptation of the sequel, if one were written. Crichton began work almost immediately and in 1995 published The Lost World. Crichton confirmed that his novel had elements taken from the novel of the same name by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.[32] The book was also an outstanding success, both with professional and amateur critics.[31] The film adaptation, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, began production in September 1996.[33]

Scott Ciencin wrote a trilogy of spin-off novels based upon Jurassic Park III. The series contained Jurassic Park Adventures: Survivor and Jurassic Park Adventures: Prey, both released in 2001, and Jurassic Park Adventures: Flyers, released the following year.

The Evolution of Claire (Jurassic World)[34] is a young adult novel written by Tess Sharpe. It is based upon the Jurassic World trilogy, and was released in 2018 in conjunction with the release of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. It is a spin-off set in 2004, prior to the opening of the Jurassic World theme park. The novel is about college freshman Claire Dearing during her summer internship at the park.[35]

John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is the owner of Jurassic Park, a theme park located on Isla Nublar. After an incident with a velociraptor, Hammond brings in three specialists to sign off on the park to calm investors. The specialists, paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) are surprised to see the island park's main attraction are living, breathing dinosaurs, created with a mixture of fossilized DNA and genetic cross-breeding/cloning. When lead programmer Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) turns off the park's power to sneak out with samples of the dinosaur embryos to sell to a corporate rival, the dinosaurs break free, and the survivors are forced to find a way to turn the power back on and make it out alive. The film also stars Bob Peck, Martin Ferrero, BD Wong, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello, and Samuel L. Jackson.

Spielberg cited Godzilla as an inspiration for Jurassic Park, specifically Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), which he grew up watching. During production, Spielberg described Godzilla as "the most masterful of all the dinosaur movies because it made you believe it was really happening."[36]

Jurassic Park is regarded as a landmark in the use of computer-generated imagery and received positive reviews from critics, who praised the effects, though reactions to other elements of the picture, such as character development, were mixed. During its release, the film grossed more than $914Â million worldwide, becoming the most successful film released up to that time (surpassing E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and surpassed 4 years later by Titanic), and it is currently the 17th highest grossing feature film (taking inflation into account, it is the 20th-highest-grossing film in North America). It is the most financially successful film for NBCUniversal and Steven Spielberg.

Recently, Jurassic Park has been proposed to be recognized as Intangible Geoheritage due to its cultural impact on the people's views about dinosaurs, including a change in the popular iconography of carnivorous dinosaurs.[37]

Jurassic Park had two re-releases: The first on September 23, 2011, in the United Kingdom and the second in which it was converted into 3D on April 5, 2013, for its 20th anniversary, which resulted in the film passing the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office.[38][39][40] In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[41]

Before The Lost World was published, a film adaptation was already in pre-production, with its release occurring in May 1997. The film was a commercial success, breaking many box-office records when released. The film had mixed reviews, similar to its predecessor in terms of characterization. Much like the first film, The Lost World: Jurassic Park made a number of changes to the plot and characters from the book, replacing the corporate rivals with an internal power struggle and changing the roles or characterizations of several protagonists.

When a vacationing family stumbles upon the dinosaurs of Isla Sorna, a secondary island where the animals were bred en masse and allowed to grow before being transported to the park, Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is called in by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to lead a team to document the island to turn it into a preserve, where the animals can roam free without interference from the outside world. Malcolm agrees to go when he discovers his girlfriend, paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already on the island, while at the same time Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), has taken over his uncle's company and leads a team of hunters to capture the creatures and bring them back to a theme park in San Diego. The two groups clash and are ultimately forced to work together to evade the predatory creatures and survive the second island. The film also stars Pete Postlethwaite, Richard Schiff, Vince Vaughn, Vanessa Lee Chester, Peter Stormare, and a young Camilla Belle.

Joe Johnston had been interested in directing the sequel to Jurassic Park and approached his friend Steven Spielberg about the project. While Spielberg wanted to direct the first sequel, he agreed that if there was ever a third film, Johnston could direct.[42] Spielberg, nevertheless, stayed involved in this film by becoming its executive producer. Production began on August 30, 2000,[43] with filming in California, and the Hawaiian islands of Kauai, Oahu, and Molokai.[44] It is the first Jurassic Park film not to be based on a novel. The film was a financial success but received mixed reviews from critics.[45]

When their son goes missing while parasailing at Isla Sorna, the Kirbys (William H. Macy and TÃ©a Leoni) hire Alan Grant (Sam Neill) under false pretenses to help them navigate the island. Believing it to be nothing more than sight-seeing, and that he will act as a dinosaur guide from the safety of their plane, he is startled to find them landing on the ground, where they are stalked by a Spinosaurus, which destroys their plane. As they search for the Kirbys' son, the situation grows dire as Velociraptors hunt their group and they must find a way off the island. The film also stars Alessandro Nivola, Michael Jeter, Trevor Morgan, Mark Harelik, and Laura Dern.

Steven Spielberg devised a story idea for a fourth film in 2001, during production of Jurassic Park III.[46] In 2002, William Monahan was hired to write the script,[47] with the film's release scheduled for 2005.[48] Early aspects of the plot included dinosaurs escaping to the mainland,[49][50][51] and an army of genetically modified dinosaur-human mercenaries.[52][53][54][55] Monahan finished the first draft of the script in 2003.[56] Sam Neill and Richard Attenborough were set to reprise their characters,[51][57] while Keira Knightley was in talks for two separate roles.[58] In 2004, John Sayles wrote two drafts of the script.[59][60] Sayles' first draft involved a team of Deinonychus being trained for use in rescue missions.[61][62][63]

Both drafts were scrapped, and a new script was being worked on in 2006.[64][65][66] Laura Dern was contacted to reprise her role, with the film expected for release in 2008.[67][68] The film was further delayed by the 2007â08 Writers Guild of America strike.[69] Mark Protosevich wrote two film treatments in 2011, which were rejected.[70] Rise of the Planet of the Apes screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver were hired in 2012 to write an early draft of the script.[71] In 2013, Colin Trevorrow was announced as a director and co-writer,[72][73] with the film scheduled for release on June 12, 2015.[74] The film was shot in Univisium 2.00:1, and received generally positive reviews.[75]

The film features a new park, Jurassic World, built on the remains of the original park on Isla Nublar.[76] The film sees the park run by Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and Masrani Corp, and features the return of Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) from the first film.[77] Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jake Johnson star, while Vincent D'Onofrio portrayed the main antagonist, Vic Hoskins. The cast also includes Lauren Lapkus,[78] Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, and Judy Greer. The primary dinosaur antagonist is Indominus rex, a genetically-modified hybrid of Tyrannosaurus rex and several other species, including Velociraptor, cuttlefish, tree frog, and pit viper.[79][80]

A sequel to Jurassic World was released on June 22, 2018.[81][82] The film was directed by J. A. Bayona and written by Trevorrow and Connolly,[82][83] with Trevorrow and Spielberg as executive producers.[82] The film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rafe Spall, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda, James Cromwell, Toby Jones, Ted Levine, BD Wong, Isabella Sermon, and Geraldine Chaplin, with Jeff Goldblum reprising his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm.[84]

During early conversations on Jurassic World, Spielberg told Trevorrow that he was interested in having several more films made.[85] In April 2014, Trevorrow announced that sequels to Jurassic World had been discussed: "We wanted to create something that would be a little bit less arbitrary and episodic, and something that could potentially arc into a series that would feel like a complete story."[86] Trevorrow, who said he would direct the film if asked,[86] later told Spielberg that he would only focus on directing one film in the series.[85] Trevorrow believed that different directors could bring different qualities to future films.[87] Bayona was once considered to direct Jurassic World, but he declined as he felt there was not enough time for production.[88] Filming took place from February to July 2017, in the United Kingdom and Hawaii.[84][89][90]

Former Jurassic World manager Claire Dearing and Velociraptor handler Owen Grady join a mission to rescue Isla Nublar's dinosaurs from a volcanic eruption by relocating them to a new island sanctuary. They discover that the mission is part of a scheme to sell the captured dinosaurs on the black market in order to fund his party's genetic research. The captured dinosaurs are brought to an estate in northern California, where several of the creatures are auctioned and subsequently shipped to their new owners. A new hybrid dinosaur, the Indoraptor (one of the primary antagonists of the film), escapes and terrorizes people at the estate, forcing Owen and Claire to survive the chaos and rampage in the estate. There's also a subplot about human cloning. Fallen Kingdom, similar to the second installment, The Lost World, re-explores the themes about the aftermath of dinosaur park's demise on Isla Nublar and dinosaurs being used for exploitation by humans, like exploiting them for militaristic applications and other uses.

Jurassic World: Dominion is scheduled for release on June 10, 2022.[91] It was directed by Trevorrow, with a screenplay written by him and Emily Carmichael, based on a story by Trevorrow and Connolly. Trevorrow and Spielberg serve as executive producers for the film, with Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley as producers.[92][93][94] The film stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, returning from the previous Jurassic World films. Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum also reprise their characters for major roles,[95] marking the trio's first film appearance together since the original Jurassic Park film.[96][97] In addition, Daniella Pineda, Justice Smith, Isabella Sermon, and Omar Sy reprise their roles from the previous two films.[98][99] Other actors include Mamoudou Athie,[100] DeWanda Wise,[101] Dichen Lachman, and Scott Haze.[102][103] Campbell Scott will be portraying the character Lewis Dodgson from the first film, originally played by Cameron Thor.[104]

Planning for the film dates to 2014.[105][83] Trevorrow and Carmichael were writing the script as of April 2018.[106] Trevorrow said the film would focus on the dinosaurs that went open source after being sold and spread around the world in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, allowing people other than Dr. Henry Wu to create their own dinosaurs.[6][107][22] Trevorrow stated that the film would be set around the world, and said that the idea of Henry Wu being the only person who knows how to create a dinosaur was far-fetched "after 30 years of this technology existing" within the films' universe.[107] Additionally, the film would focus on the dinosaurs that were freed at the end of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,[6][107][22] but it would not depict dinosaurs terrorizing cities and going to war against humans; Trevorrow considered such ideas unrealistic. Instead, Trevorrow was interested in a world where "dinosaur interaction is unlikely but possibleâthe same way we watch out for bears or sharks."[108][109] Certain scenes and ideas regarding the integration of dinosaurs into the world were ultimately removed from the Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom script to be saved for the third film.[107][22]

Filming locations included Canada, England's Pinewood Studios, and the country of Malta.[91][110] Jurassic World: Dominion began filming in February 2020,[91] but was put on hiatus several weeks later as a safety precaution due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[111] Production resumed in July 2020, with numerous health precautions in place, including COVID-19 testing and social distancing.[112] Filming wrapped four months later.[91]

Marshall said in May 2020 that Jurassic World: Dominion will not be the final film in the franchise and that it would instead mark "the start of a new era", in which humans have to adjust to dinosaurs being on the mainland.[113]

Battle at Big Rock is the first live-action short film in the franchise, and was released on September 15, 2019. The eight-minute film was directed by Colin Trevorrow,[114] and was co-written by him and Emily Carmichael. The film stars AndrÃ© Holland, Natalie Martinez, Melody Hurd, and Pierson Salvador.[114][115]

The film is set one year after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. In the film, a family goes on a camping trip at the fictional Big Rock National Park in northern California, approximately 20 miles from where dinosaurs from Fallen Kingdom were let loose. The film chronicles the first major confrontation between humans and the dinosaurs.[114]

A five-minute Jurassic World Dominion prologue was released in 2021, serving as the franchise's second live-action short film. It was originally intended as the film's opening sequence before being removed from the final cut. It features a prehistoric segment showcasing dinosaurs in their natural habitats, then cuts to the present day as a cloned T. rex wreaks havoc at a drive-in theater.[116][117]

Lego produced various CGI-animated projects, including the two-part television special Lego Jurassic World: The Secret Exhibit, which aired on NBC on November 29, 2018.[118] A 13-episode miniseries, Lego Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar, premiered in 2019. It was broadcast on Family Channel in Canada and on Nickelodeon in the U.S.[119][120]

Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous is a CGI-animated series that debuted on Netflix in 2020. It is a joint project between Netflix, Universal Studios, Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Animation. Scott Kreamer and Lane Lueras are the showrunners, and executive produce the series with Spielberg, Marshall, and Trevorrow, while Zack Stentz serves as consulting producer. The series is set during the events of the first Jurassic World film, and is about a group of six teenagers attending an adventure camp on Isla Nublar. When the park's dinosaurs escape, the teenagers are stranded and must work together to escape the island.[121] The series consists of 37 episodes and premiered globally on Netflix on September 18, 2020. The voice cast includes Paul-MikÃ©l Williams, Jenna Ortega, Ryan Potter, Raini Rodriguez, Sean Giambrone, Kausar Mohammed, Jameela Jamil, and Glen Powell.[122][123]

A live-action television series based on the Jurassic Park franchise is in development as of March 2020. The series, which takes place in the same continuity as the films, will be developed by Amblin Television, with Trevorrow and Spielberg serving as producers. Co-presidents of Amblin Television, Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey, will also serve as producers. Production is scheduled to take place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.[124][125][126]

In June 1993, after the theatrical release of Jurassic Park, spokesmen for Amblin and MCA confirmed that an animated series based on the film was in development and awaiting Spielberg's final approval.[127] The series, titled Escape from Jurassic Park,[128] would have consisted of 23 episodes for its first season. The series would have centered on John Hammond's attempts to finish Jurassic Park and open it to the public, while InGen's corporate rival Biosyn is simultaneously planning to open their own dinosaur theme park in Brazil, which ultimately ends with their dinosaurs escaping into the jungles.[129][130][131]

If produced, it was believed that the project would be the most expensive animated series up to that time. Jeff Segal, president of Universal Cartoon Studios, said, "We are developing a TV series that we anticipate would be computer animated and very sophisticated. However, Spielberg has not had a chance yet to look at either the material or the format for the series."[127] Segal said Universal was considering the possibility of developing the series for prime time. Segal said about the series' storyline, "It would essentially pick up from the closing moments of the movie and it would continue the story in a very dramatic way. The intention would be to continue with the primary characters and also introduce new characters." Segal also said the series would be aimed specifically at the same target audience as the film, while hoping that it would also appeal to young children.[127]

Animation veteran and comic artist Will Meugniot (then working at Universal Cartoon Studios for various projects, including Exosquad) contacted artist William Stout to ask if he would be interested in designing the animated series. According to Stout, "This was not going to be a kiddy show (although kids of all ages, including myself, could enjoy it). They wanted the show to be a mature prime time series with top writers and state-of-the-art television animation augmented with quite a bit of CG animation." Universal Animation Studios wanted the show to have the look of a graphic novel.[132]

Stout was hired to work on the series and subsequently made a trailer to demonstrate how the series would look, and how it would combine traditional animation with computer animation. The series required Spielberg's final approval before it could go into production. However, Spielberg had grown tired of the massive promotion and merchandise revolving around the film, and never watched the trailer.[132] On July 13, 1993, Margaret Loesch, president of the Fox Children's Network, confirmed that discussions had been held with Spielberg about an animated version of the film. Loesch also said, "At least for now and in the foreseeable future, there will not be an animated Jurassic Park. That's Steven Spielberg's decision, and we respect that decision."[133]

Part three of the four-part comic adaptation of The Lost World: Jurassic Park, published by Topps Comics in July 1997, confirmed to readers that a cartoon series based on the film was in development.[134][135] It was commissioned by Spielberg and would be developed by DreamWorks Animation.[136] In November 1997, it was reported that the cartoon would be accompanied by Jurassic Park: Chaos Effect, a series of dinosaur toys produced by Kenner and based on a premise that scientists had created dinosaur hybrids consisting of DNA from different creatures.[137][138] The new toys were based on the upcoming cartoon.[137] It was also reported that the cartoon could be ready by March 1998, as a mid-season replacement.[137] The Chaos Effect toyline was released in June 1998,[138] but the animated series was never produced, for unknown reasons.[139]

For the 1993 film, Kenner produced a line of action figures and dinosaurs,[160] marketed with the slogan, "If it's not 'Jurassic Park,' it's extinct".[161][162] Paleontologist Jack Horner, who offered his advice for the film's dinosaurs, was also hired as a scientific advisor for the dinosaur toys.[163] Kenner had two years to develop the toys, which sold successfully.[164] Dakin also produced stuffed dinosaurs based on the film.[160]

Kenner produced another toy line for the 1997 sequel.[165] The company also released Jurassic Park: Chaos Effect a year later.[166][167] The toy line's premise involved scientists who had created new dinosaur species by combining the DNA of existing dinosaurs.[168][169][170]

Kenner's parent company, Hasbro, took over toy production for Jurassic Park III, released in 2001.[171] At that time, Playskool also released a toy line aimed at young children, under the name Jurassic Park Junior.[172][173] Jurassic Park III toys were also released under the Lego Studios brand.[174][175] Hasbro also created a toy line for Jurassic World.[176][177] Some of the toy dinosaurs had been referred to on packaging as males, despite being females in the film. This drew some criticism which accused Hasbro of catering solely to a male demographic.[178][179] Hasbro updated the pronouns shortly after the toy line's release.[180] The Lego Jurassic World line was also released in 2015.

In July 2016, Mattel announced an agreement to take over the toy license from Hasbro, in a deal set to take effect one year later.[181][182][183] Mattel produced various toys for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,[184] including dinosaurs, action figures,[185][186] and Barbie dolls.[187] Mattel's dinosaur toys included symbols which could be scanned with a cell phone, providing facts about each animal through a mobile app known as Jurassic World Facts.[186][188] Lego and Funko also created toys based on the film.[189][190] In addition, Mattel released the Jurassic World Legacy Collection, which included toys based on characters and dinosaurs from the Jurassic Park trilogy.[191][192]

In 2019, Mattel unveiled the Amber Collection, a toy line of posable characters and dinosaurs[193] that had been featured in the first film.[194][195][196][197] A year later, the company released toys based on Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous.[198][199] In February 2021, Mattel and Target partnered to sell a line of toys custom-made by the fan site Jurassic Outpost.[200]

Board games were released by Milton Bradley for the first two Jurassic Park films.[201][202][203][204] Hasbro and Milton Bradley also released two board games for Jurassic Park III.[172][205][206]

Jurassic Park: Danger! was released in 2018, and pits humans and dinosaurs against each other.[207] Meanwhile, Mondo was working on a board game to be known as Jurassic Park: The Chaos Gene,[208][209][210] although it was canceled during development.[211] In 2019, Mondo announced that characters and dinosaurs from the Jurassic Park franchise would be released as playable characters for its Unmatched board game.[212] The first set of characters was released in 2020.[213]

In 2021, Hasbro released a version of Monopoly based on the original Jurassic Park film.[214][215] That year, Funko also partnered with Universal and Amblin to design a legacy board game based on both film trilogies. It is scheduled for release in 2022.[216][217]

From June 1993 to August 1997, the now-defunct Topps Comics published comic adaptations of Jurassic Park and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, as well as several tie-in series.

Beginning in June 2010, IDW Publishing began publishing Jurassic Park comics. They also acquired the rights to reprint the issues published by Topps in the 1990s, which they began to do in trade paperback format starting in November 2010. After a four-year hiatus, IDW announced a comic series based on Jurassic World that was to be released in 2017.[219]

This series has been collected in the following trade paperbacks:

In late 2019, a Jurassic World motion comic series was released by Universal on YouTube. The four-part series is set after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and explores various dinosaur attacks throughout the world.[224][225][226]

Since 1993, numerous Jurassic Park video games have been produced. To accompany the release of the first film, Sega and Ocean Software published several different games for various consoles, including the NES and Sega Genesis. In 1994, Ocean produced a game sequel titled Jurassic Park 2: The Chaos Continues, while Sega released Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In addition, Universal Interactive Studios produced Jurassic Park Interactive for the 3DO system.
