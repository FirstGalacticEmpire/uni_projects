Taika David Cohen[4][5][6] was born in Raukokore in the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand's North Island,[7] and grew up in both the East Coast and the Aro Valley of Wellington.[8][9] His father was an artist of Te Whānau-ā-Apanui descent, whilst his mother, Robin Cohen,[10] is a schoolteacher.[11][12] Waititi stated that his mother's family were Russian Jews "mixed with a bit of Irish" and other European ancestry, while his father's side was "Māori and a little bit of French Canadian".[13] Waititi describes himself as a "Polynesian Jew", although he has stated that he never grew up in an "actively practising Jewish household".[14][15][16]

Waititi's parents split up when he was around five,[17] and he was raised primarily by his mother.[8] He attended Onslow College,[18] then studied theatre at Victoria University of Wellington where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1997.[19] He originally used his mother's surname, Cohen, for his work in film and writing, and his father's, Waititi, for visual arts endeavours.[4][20] Following the success of his first short film, he continued to use Waititi professionally.[21]

While a student at Victoria University, Waititi was part of the five-member ensemble So You're a Man, which toured New Zealand and Australia with some success.[22] He was half of the comedy duo The Humourbeasts alongside Jemaine Clement, which received New Zealand's highest comedy accolade, the Billy T Award, in 1999.[23] Among a variety of artistic interests, Waititi began making comical short films for New Zealand's annual 48-hour film contest.[24] His short film Two Cars, One Night earned him an Academy Award nomination in 2005.[25] At the awards ceremony, he famously feigned falling asleep as the nominations were being read.[26][27] His first feature film, a romantic comedy called Eagle vs Shark, was released in U.S. theatres for limited distribution in 2007.[28] It stars Waititi's then-real-life partner, Loren Horsley.[29] That year, Waititi wrote and directed one episode of the TV show Flight of the Conchords and directed another.[30]

His second feature, Boy, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2010,[31] and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize. Waititi also took one of the main roles, as the ex-con father who returns to his family. On its release in New Zealand, Boy received enthusiastic reviews[32] and was successful at the local box office, eclipsing several records.[33] Following the film's success, Waititi hoped its signature track, "Poi E", would get to #1 (for the second time) on the New Zealand charts.[34] It reached #3, but became #1 on iTunes.[35] In 2011, Waititi directed New Zealand TV series Super City starring Madeleine Sami, who plays five characters living in one city.[36] That year, Waititi portrayed Thomas Kalmaku in the superhero film Green Lantern.[37]

In 2013, Waititi co-wrote, co-directed and acted in the vampire comedy mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows with Clement.[38] It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2014.[39] Waititi and Clement played members of a group of vampires who live in an appropriately gothic house in modern-day Wellington.[40] A television adaptation of the film was commissioned in May 2018, with Waititi as an executive producer and director.[41] The series of the same name premiered on FX in March 2019;[42] its second season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series.[43]

Waititi's fourth feature, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival.[44] When it was released in New Zealand, the comedy adventure broke Waititi's own record for a New Zealand film in its opening weekend.[45] Based on a book by Barry Crump, it centres on a young boy (played by Julian Dennison) and a grumpy man (played by Sam Neill) on the run in the forest. Waititi wrote the initial screenplay for the 2016 Disney film Moana,[46] which focused on gender and family. Those elements were passed over in favour of what became the final story.[47]

In 2017, Waititi won the award for New Zealander of the Year, but was unable to receive it in person due to work commitments.[48] That year, he directed his first major studio film, Marvel Studios's Thor: Ragnarok, which was released in October.[49][50] He also portrayed Korg, a Kronan, via motion capture in the film.[51] He had previously directed a short film series for Marvel called Team Thor, chronicling the lives of Thor and his roommate, Darryl Jacobson.[52] Thor: Ragnarok earned critical praise and was successful at the box office.[53][54] Waititi was later consulted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on Thor's storylines for Avengers: Infinity War, to maintain the character's consistency in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[55][56]

In 2019, Waititi wrote and directed Jojo Rabbit, based on the book Caging Skies by Christine Leunens, the 1940s-set story of a child in the Hitler Youth whose mother is secretly hiding a Jewish girl in their home. Waititi plays Adolf Hitler as the boy's imaginary friend.[57] Waititi received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. He won the latter,[58][59] making him the first person of Māori descent to win an Academy Award in a screenplay category, and the first indigenous person to be nominated for and win Best Adapted Screenplay.[60] In 2021 he won the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media as a producer of the Jojo Rabbit soundtrack.[61]

In October 2018, Lucasfilm announced that Waititi would be one of the directors of the Star Wars live-action streaming series The Mandalorian, which tells the story of a lone Mandalorian gunfighter in the period between the events of Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.[62] The series premiered on 12 November 2019; Waititi also voices a droid bounty hunter named IG-11 in the series.[63] He directed the series' first-season finale, "Chapter 8: Redemption".[64] His voiceover work earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance in 2020.[43]
