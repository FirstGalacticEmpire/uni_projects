The Boring Test Tunnel is a 1.1 miles (1.8 km) tunnel in Hawthorne, California for testing Hyperloop and Loop-based transportation.[3] It was completed by The Boring Company in late 2018. The single-bore tunnel was constructed during 2017‒2018 using a 14-foot (4.2 m) diameter tunnel boring machine, giving a finished 12-foot (3.8 m) internal diameter.

Most of the route runs outside and set back from the perimeter of Hawthorne Municipal Airport, with a very short section under the corner of the airport fence, without going under the runway.[4]

The tunnel starts between the Dominguez Channel storm drain and Crenshaw Boulevard at an entrance pit constructed on car park land owned by SpaceX.  A short straight section heading northwards is followed by a 530-foot-radius (161.5 m) curve westwards under West 120th Street, then a long straight tunnel, a slight curve and a final short straight to the Exit Shaft.  The midpoint of the tunnel is planned to connect with a very short northwards spur to a small car parking system-style car elevator leading up inside a residential garage behind a house at 3834 West 119th Place.[5]

On December 17, 2016, Elon Musk stated that he was frustrated with traffic jams, and would start building a tunnel.[6]  By April 2017, The Boring Company had obtained a second-hand tunnel boring machine, transported the machine to Hawthorne, and had it repainted in Boring Company colors.[7]

On January 31, 2018, the Boring Company acquired the land around a family house at 3834 West 119th Place for $500,000.[8]  On May 9, 2018, the Boring Company acquired land on the corner of West 120th and Prairie Avenue for $2 million, purchasing the corner plots 309 and 308 at 12007 Prairie Avenue[9] and Plots 304‒307 behind.[10]

On October 5, 2018, the Hawthorne City Council granted an easement for up to 2,600 meters (8,600 ft) of tunnel, in exchange for a structural encroachment fee of $2.5 million. Permission for the first 210 meters (700 ft) of tunnel under SpaceX's own land had been obtained earlier.[11]

On October 17, 2018, in preparation for opening "The Brick Store", the company applied for permission to paint the building at 12003 Prairie Avenue in The Boring Company black-and-white corporate colors.[12]

An opening ceremony for the test tunnel was originally scheduled for December 10, 2018,[13] then moved to December 18, 2018.[14]

During the launch day on December 18, 2018, cars operated using guided busway-style side-facing guide wheels.  This fleet of Tesla Model X vehicles travelled at up to 40 miles per hour (65 km/h).[15]
