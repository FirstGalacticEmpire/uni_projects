Riley grew up in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire,[3] the only child of Una Riley, founder of a security systems company and a public relations company,[4] and Doug Milburn, formerly head of the National Crime Squad. As of October 2021[update], her father works as a screenwriter and has written episodes of Silent Witness, Prime Suspect and The Bill. Riley was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College, independent Berkhamsted Collegiate School, and independent Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls. While acting in London, she studied for a degree in Natural Sciences at the Open University.[5]

Riley's television credits include episodes of Poirot (2003), Marple (2006), Doctor Who (2008's "Silence in the Library" and "Forest of the Dead"). She played Lila, a love-struck writer, in the short-lived E4 series Nearly Famous (2007).[6]  She played Angela in the first two seasons of the television series Westworld.[7]

Riley made her stage debut in The Philadelphia Story at the Old Vic in 2005. Her performance in a 2006 revival Tennessee Williams' Summer and Smoke was described by critic Rachel Read as being "delightful".[8]

Riley played Mary Bennet in the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice, acted in the role of Marianne in 2009's The Boat That Rocked, and starred in the 2007 film St Trinian's and its 2009 sequel St Trinian's: The Legend of Fritton's Gold.[9][10]

Riley appeared as a disguise used by Tom Hardy's character in Inception (2010). Also in 2010, Love and Distrust was released direct-to-video, featuring five unique short films; Riley was co-lead, opposite Robert Pattinson, by 2010 in the midst of his The Twilight Saga series popularity, in the 2008 short The Summer House, the first of the five works in Love and Distrust.

Between 2009 and 2015 Riley developed an idea and story by her father into a screenplay, then ultimately directed (unintentionally, after being unable to hire another director to helm the project[13]) and also starred in the resulting feature film Scottish Mussel.

Her debut novel, Acts of Love, was published by Hodder & Stoughton in August 2016.[14][15]

She was featured on the March 2010 cover of Esquire.[16][17]

In 2008, Riley began dating billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and in 2010 they married at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[19][20] In January 2012, Musk ended his four-year relationship with Riley,[21][22] and sought a divorce by March 2012.[21][23]

In July 2013, however, Musk and Riley remarried.[24] In a 60 Minutes interview in 2014, the couple stated that they had reconciled and were living together again, along with Musk's five children from his first marriage to writer Justine Musk.[25]

On 31 December 2014, Musk filed for divorce a second time; however, the action was withdrawn.[26][27] After living separately for six months Riley filed for a second divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court on 21 March 2016.[19] The divorce was finalised in October 2016.[28]
