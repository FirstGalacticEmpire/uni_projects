The assignment of telephone numbers in Poland is controlled by the Office of Electronic Communications (UrzÄ…d Komunikacji Elektronicznej or UKE), the national regulatory authority.

Polish telephone numbers have had 9 digits since 30 September 2009.[1] The prefix '0' is no longer used when making a call within the country.[2]

9 digits, starting with 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 (not all).

The same codes are used by mobile virtual network operators.
