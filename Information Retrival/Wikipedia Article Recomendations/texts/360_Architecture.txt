360 Architecture was an American architectural practice acquired by HOK in 2015. The firm provided services for a range of project types including corporate headquarters and commercial office buildings, sports arenas, stadiums and ballparks, municipal facilities, single- and multi-family residential and mixed-use entertainment districts. The firm was headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, with offices in Columbus Ohio; and San Francisco, California.[1]  As of 2014[update], the firm had a staff of 200 professionals.

In January 2015, HOK completed its acquisition of 360 Architecture for an undisclosed price and announced the launch of a new global Sports + Recreation + Entertainment practice. Brad Schrock, a 360 Architecture co-founder and a director of this new HOK practice, said the acquisition would help the firms compete at the highest level.[2]

CDFM2 Architecture Inc. and Heinlein Schrock Stearns merged in 2004 to form 360 Architecture. At the time, CDFM2 was a firm of sixty architects, interior architects, interior designers, 3D illustrators and graphic designers working in the corporate, developer service, government and higher education markets. Heinlein Schrock Stearns was a firm of thirty-six architects and designers focused on collegiate, minor- and major-league sports and commercial, residential and retail/entertainment projects. The merger combined thirty-four years of firm experience into 360 Architecture (CDFM2 founded in 1980 and Heinlein Schrock Stearns founded in 1995).

The firm worked on some of the largest sporting venues in the U.S., such as Avaya Stadium, home of the San Jose Earthquakes professional soccer team in San Jose, California,[3] Husky Stadium in Seattle, Washington, home of the Washington Huskies football team, and MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the New York Giants and the New York Jets professional football teams.[4] 360 Architecture was also a member of the Kansas City Downtown Arena Design Team (DADT). The DADT is the architect of record for the Sprint Center in downtown Kansas City.[5]

360 Architecture is the designer for the thirteen-block revitalization project of downtown Kansas City.[6]  Other 360 Architecture projects in the downtown Kansas City area include the J.E. Dunn Construction Company corporate headquarters,[7] the U.S. Internal Revenue Service Center and post office renovation,[8] H&R Block world headquarters[9] and the Boulevard Brewing Company expansion.[10]
