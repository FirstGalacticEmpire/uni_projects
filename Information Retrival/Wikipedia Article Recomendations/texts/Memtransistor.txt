The memtransistor is an experimental multi-terminal electronic component that might be used in the construction of artificial neural networks.[1] It is a combination of the memristor and transistor.[2] Applications of memristor technology is limited by it being a two terminal device. The multiple connections of the memtransistor enable it to more accurately model a neuron with its multiple synaptic connections. A neural network produced from these would provide hardware-based artificial intelligence with a good foundation.[1][3]

Researchers at Northwestern University have fabricated a seven-terminal device fabricated on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). One terminal controls the current between the other six.[4]
