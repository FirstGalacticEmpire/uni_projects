Junichi Sato (佐藤 順一, Satō Jun'ichi, born March 11, 1960) is a Japanese anime director, best known for working on shōjo-based anime and in the magical girl genre. He was formerly associated with TYO Animations (formerly Hal Film Maker).

Born in Ama, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, his first major work was directing the first two seasons of Sailor Moon for Toei Animation, after which he handed the position over to Kunihiko Ikuhara, although he continued to storyboard and direct episodes for the later seasons. He later went on to co-direct Ojamajo Doremi and Princess Tutu. Sato served as chief director for long-runner Sgt. Frog, and in recent years has become more known for his "healing anime" such as Aria and Tamayura.
