Andor is an upcoming American television series created by Tony Gilroy for the streaming service Disney+. It is a prequel to the Star Wars film Rogue One (2016), following the character Cassian Andor five years before the events of the film.

Diego Luna executive produces and reprises his Rogue One role as Cassian Andor. Stellan Skarsgård, Adria Arjona, Fiona Shaw, Denise Gough, Kyle Soller, and Genevieve O'Reilly also star. Lucasfilm announced a series focused on Andor in November 2018, with Luna attached and Stephen Schiff hired as showrunner. Schiff was replaced by Rogue One co-writer Gilroy as creator and showrunner in April 2020. Filming began at the end of November 2020, with Gilroy unable to direct as planned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming took place at Pinewood Studios in London, and on location around the United Kingdom, and wrapped by September 2021.

Andor is scheduled to be released in mid-to-late 2022, and will consist of 12 episodes.

Set five years before the events of Rogue One (2016),[1] the series follows rebel spy Cassian Andor during the formative years of the Rebellion.[2]

Additionally, Forest Whitaker returns as Saw Gerrera, a veteran of the Clone Wars and the leader of a militant insurgent group.[5] Robert Emms has been cast in an undisclosed supporting role.[6]

In addition to the first episode, Toby Haynes is directing the second and third episodes.[7] Ben Caron and Susanna White are also directing episodes.[9]

Disney CEO Bob Iger announced in November 2017 that Disney and Lucasfilm were developing a live-action Star Wars television series for the new streaming service Disney+.[10] In February 2018, he clarified that there were several series in development for the service.[11] One of these series was revealed that November to be a prequel to the film Rogue One (2016). It was described as a spy thriller focused on the character Cassian Andor, with Diego Luna reprising his role from the film. Production was expected to begin in 2019 after Luna completed filming the second season of Narcos: Mexico.[2] Jared Bush originally developed the series, writing a pilot script and series bible for the project.[12]

By the end of November 2018, Stephen Schiff was serving as showrunner and executive producer of the series.[12] In July 2019, Rick Famuyiwa was in early talks to direct several episodes of the series after doing the same for the first live-action Star Wars series, The Mandalorian.[13] That October, Tony Gilroy joined the series to write the first episode, direct multiple episodes, and work alongside Schiff. Gilroy was credited as a co-writer on Rogue One and oversaw extensive reshoots for the film.[8] By April 2020, Gilroy had officially replaced Schiff as showrunner.[1] Six weeks of pre-production for the series had taken place in the United Kingdom, but this was halted and production on the series delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[14][15] Pre-production had begun again by September ahead of a planned filming start the next month. At that time, Gilroy, who is based in New York, chose not to travel to the UK for production on the series due to the pandemic, and was therefore unable to direct the series' first episode. Instead, the UK-based Toby Haynes, who was already "high on the list" of potential directors for the series, was hired to direct the first three episodes. Gilroy would remain executive producer and showrunner.[7]

Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy announced the series' title, Andor, in December 2020, along with its 2022 release date. Luna was revealed to be executive producing the series, which was set to consist of 12 episodes.[4][16] Luna expressed his excitement at being able to explore the character further in the series after the bittersweet experience of making Rogue One, in which the character dies.[16] In February 2021, Ben Caron and Susanna White were set as additional directors for the series.[9]

In addition to Gilroy and Schiff, writers for the series include Beau Willimon and Gilroy's brother Dan.[1] Speaking to the fact that the series would lead into the events of Rogue One, Luna felt it was "nice to go into a story you already know the ending. Now you can take the nuances and the layers. I think it’s fun to do something that isn’t just about getting to the end. It’s about delaying that."[17] He added that the series was about "the building of a revolution".[16]

Luke Hull serves as production designer on the series,[18] and described it as "very cinematic".[16] Neal Scanlan provides the creature and droid effects for the series after doing the same for all of Disney's Star Wars films, including Rogue One.[19] He said his team was treating the series the same as they did the films,[16] and due to Gilroy's involvement the series would fit within the same "pocket of [Star Wars] history" as Rogue One with a "slightly harder edge" than other Star Wars projects.[19] Scanlan added that creatures developed for the films that ultimately did not appear or that only made brief appearances could be brought back for the series,[20] alongside new creatures developed for the series.[16]

Diego Luna was confirmed to be reprising his role as Cassian Andor from the film Rogue One with the series' announcement in November 2018.[2] In April 2019, Alan Tudyk was announced as also reprising his Rogue One role of K-2SO for the series.[21] A year later, Stellan Skarsgård, Kyle Soller, Genevieve O'Reilly, and Denise Gough joined the cast. O'Reilly reprises her role of Mon Mothma from Rogue One and other previous Star Wars media.[22][1] Adria Arjona joined the cast in August 2020,[3] and Fiona Shaw was revealed to also be appearing in the series in December,[4] when Tudyk was not included in an official cast list. A month later, Tudyk confirmed that he would no longer be appearing in the series' first season due to Gilroy's story changes, but said he could appear in potential future seasons.[23]

The series has over 200 named cast members and over 6000 extras.[16] Robert Emms was cast in a supporting role in June 2021,[6] and Skarsgård revealed that Forest Whitaker would be appearing in the series, reprising his role as Saw Gerrera from Rogue One.[5]

Filming for the series began in London, England, at the end of November 2020,[17][24] with the production based at Pinewood Studios.[25][26] The series is filmed under the working title Pilgrim,[25] with Toby Haynes directing the first three episodes of the series,[7] and Jonathan Freeman serving as cinematographer.[27] The series was previously reported to be beginning filming in 2019,[2] and then June 2020,[27] but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[15] Both British and U.S. COVID-19 protocols were followed on set, including daily temperature checks and tests for COVID-19 three times a week.[26] Filming at Pinewood Studios was expected to end in July 2021.[26]

By late January 2021, a large village set had been built for the series on the grounds of a former quarry in Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire, not far from Pinewood Studios. Filming was expected to take place there until April.[28] Filming in April also took place at the Coryton Refinery in Corringham, Essex.[29] Several days of filming happened in Cleveleys on the Fylde Coast of Lancashire in early May, with the town's promenade and beach area dressed as an alien location,[25] followed by another several days filming in the disused Winspit quarry in Dorset.[30][31] Second unit and location filming began for at least a week at the end of May in Black Park, a country park in Buckinghamshire near Pinewood Studios which was also used for filming Disney's Star Wars films.[32][33] By the end of May, main production on Pilgrim had moved to Glen Tilt in Perthshire, Scotland, and was expected to continue there until late June.[34][35] Filming took place at Middle Peak Quarry near Wirksworth, Derbyshire, from June 22 to 24.[36][37] Production was expected to wrap in mid-2021,[6] and Luna confirmed that filming had been completed by September 27.[38]

A sizzle reel featuring behind-the-scenes footage of pre-production and filming was released during Disney's Investors Day presentation in December 2020, when the series' title and cast was officially announced by Kennedy.[4][16]

The series is scheduled to be released on Disney+ in mid-to-late 2022,[39] and will consist of 12 episodes.[4] It was previously expected to debut in 2021,[40] before production was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.[15]
