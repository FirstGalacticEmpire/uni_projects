Asaki Takamori (高森 朝樹, Takamori Asaki, September 4, 1936 – January 21, 1987), known by the pen names Ikki Kajiwara (梶原 一騎, Kajiwara Ikki) and Asao Takamori (高森 朝, Takamori Asao), was a Japanese author, manga writer, and film producer. He is known for the work about sports and martial arts, with images of heroic young men with the occasional fine details as he moves from one topic to another. He considered Tiger Mask and Star of the Giants to be his life's work.[1]

The son of an illustrator and editor, Takamori was a notorious juvenile delinquent with an interest on fighting. After World War II, his family moved to Tokyo, where he jumped schools until landing a job as a novelist at 17. He adopted the pen names Ikki Kajiwara and Asao Takamori, since he was writing for a rival magazine at the time.[2]

He was married to Pai Bing-bing and fathered a daughter, Pai Hsiao-yen, who was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered in 1997.
